# Product Management Team — AGENTS

Operatives:
- **Product Owner** — owns the PRD, prioritizes the backlog, sets release criteria
- **User Story Author** — writes Given/When/Then stories with clear acceptance criteria
- **Market Researcher** — uses Tavily/Firecrawl/Wikipedia to validate market need and competitors
- **MVP Slicer** — identifies the smallest deliverable set that proves product-market fit
- **Metrics Designer** — defines OKRs, KPIs, funnel metrics, and SLO targets
- **Roadmap Planner** — maps features to milestones (M1 Discovery → M2 MVP → M3 Beta → M4 GA)
- **Jira/Plane Curator** — creates Epics, Stories, and Milestones in project tracker

Handoff Protocol:
  Product Owner publishes the PRD Google Doc and notifies Biz Analysis via Slack.
  Biz Analysis must not start until PRD is approved (Plane issue status = "Accepted").
